			<description>As a member of this class, you have the ability to create experimental elixirs. At the end of a long rest, you can produce one elixir by touching an empty flask and rolling on the Experimental Elixir table to determine its effect. You can also create additional elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher and choosing the elixir's effect from the table, but you must have alchemist supplies and each elixir requires its own flask. The elixir lasts until it is consumed or until the end of your next long rest. As you gain levels in this class, you will be able to produce two elixirs at 6th level and three elixirs at 15th level, rolling for the effect of each elixir separately. You can use an action to drink an elixir yourself or give it to an incapacitated creature.</description>
